# AICW Final Project
# AI-Powered Prawn Monitoring System for Disease, Type, and Size Prediction
# Project Problem statement
 Prawn farmers face many problems in daily farming, such as late detection of diseases, lack of proper farming guidance, and difficulty in identifying prawn type and size.
Most farmers depend on manual checking and experience, which is time-consuming and not always accurate.

There is no single platform that gives disease detection, farming guidance, pond preparation steps, soil management, and prawn information in one system.

So, this project aims to develop a smart AI-based prawn farming system that:
- Detects prawn diseases using images
- Identifies prawn type and size
- Provides scientific farming guidance (pond, soil, growth, diseases)
- Supports farmers with a simple, user-friendly application
- This system helps farmers take early action, reduce losses, and improve prawn production.

  # Solution Approach
1.User-Friendly Web Application :
 A simple web application is developed using Streamlit, so farmers can easily use the system without technical knowledge.

2.Image Upload for Prediction
The farmer uploads a prawn image through the application.
The image is resized and preprocessed to make it suitable for the AI model.

3.AI-Based Disease Detection
A trained deep learning model (CNN) analyzes the uploaded image and predicts the prawn disease accurately.

4.Prawn Type Identification
The system identifies the prawn type (White-leg, Tiger, or Scampi) based on image features such as shape and size.

5.Prawn Size Estimation
The system estimates prawn size (Very Small, Small, Medium, Large) using image area and ratio calculation.

6.Disease Information & Solution
Based on the detected disease, the system displays:

- Disease details

- Risk level

- Prevention and treatment suggestions

7.Farming Guidance Module
The application provides guidance on:

- Pond preparation

- Soil management

- Polyculture

- Growth stages
This helps farmers follow scientific farming practices.

8.Multilingual Support
The system supports multiple languages (English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil) so farmers can easily understand the information.

9.Interactive Chatbot Support
A chatbot is included to answer common farmer questions and provide instant guidance.
